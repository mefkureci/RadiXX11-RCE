TARGET DESCRIPTION                                                              
¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨                                                              
. O&O AutoBackup: O&O AutoBackup will backup your files automatically and keep  
them fully in sync. Backup your photos and videos onto an external HDD or USB in
no time! O&O AutoBackup copies the original files and syncs any future changes  
to them. The backup process is 100% automatic and begins like plug and play     
whenever a portable device such as an external HDD or USB Stick is connected to 
the computer. The files are copied 1-1 and put on the target disk drive. This   
means they can also be accessed without O&O AutoBackup simply by navigation in  
the usual way over Windows Explorer.                                            
                                                                                
. O&O BlueCon: O&O BlueCon is at an administrator’s side during the course of a 
daily routine as well as whenever disaster strikes. Based on Windows PE, it     
offers a wide range of programs for, among other things, repairing systems,     
searching and correcting errors, restoring lost data, resetting passwords, and  
the list goes on. O&O BlueCon is an administrator’s IT first aid kit for day to 
day use.                                                                        
O&O BlueCon starts all programs directly from a bootable medium (CD/DVD or USB  
stick) and can so avoid the risk of data loss caused by overwriting data on the 
computer, which might be the case with a new installation. Seamless integration 
of all O&O BlueCon components saves the user the time-consuming job of          
collecting individual programs.                                                 
                                                                                
. O&O BrowserPrivacy: The history and data saved in your browser can reveal a   
lot about you and your internet activities. Cookies, for example, make it easy  
for websites to identify and follow you. With just the push of a button, O&O    
BrowserPrivacy destroys all the data collected in the browsers you use. It lets 
you set the level of security at which your data should be destroyed. This gives
you complete control over which data in the respective browser O&O              
BrowserPrivacy should permanently delete for you. This applies, of course, only 
to those browsers supported by O&O BrowserPrivacy.                              
                                                                                
. O&O CleverCache: O&O CleverCache makes sure that the file cache is reset while
the computer’s running: something that otherwise usually requires a restart of  
the computer. O&O CleverCache will let you continuously maintain maximum levels 
of performance on your computer – no new start required, and with just a few    
clicks of your mouse.                                                           
O&O CleverCache prevents those infamous program and application “freezes” where 
usually only closing the program with the Windows Task Manager can help. Simply 
install O&O CleverCache and let it take care of your computer or servers memory 
management.                                                                     
                                                                                
. O&O Defrag: Let O&O Defrag optimize your hard disks and SSDs and you can      
experience speed increases of up to 100%! Regular disk defragmentation optimizes
your PC performance!                                                            
                                                                                
. O&O DiskErase: O&O DiskErase is able to safely destroy all the contents of    
your machine, even the files normally locked by Windows. The TotalErase function
developed by O&O really annihilates all the data that is on your computer. You  
do not even need a boot medium that would need to be created in a complicated   
way. O&O DiskErase is capable of destroying the entire content of your PC after 
a reboot. Important! Please note that once deleted with O&O DiskErase data can  
not be restored. Not even by special software and hardware. Take this into      
account and avoid accidentally deleting your data!                              
                                                                                
. O&O DiskImage: O&O DiskImage lets you back up an entire computer or single    
files whenever you want – even while the computer is being used. In the event   
you should lose your personal data it can be quickly restored with just a few   
mouse clicks – even when Windows is no longer able to start. It also supports   
SSD drives and the latest UEFI System.                                          
                                                                                
. O&O DiskRecovery: O&O DiskRecovery functionality begins where other programs  
leave off. This software combs every sector of a hard disk, memory card, or     
digital camera to find lost files. Even when files systems are format-ted or    
destroyed, it is possible to reconstruct once deleted data. Over 400 file types 
and version can be recognized and restored, including Word docu-ments, Excel    
workbooks, Access databases, and virtually every sort of commonly used graphics,
photo, movie, and music formats (SVG, MP4, BLEND, AUP, JPEG, AVI, MPEG, MP3, WAV
, BMP, TIFF, Corel Draw, Photoshop, Framemaker, Adobe Illustrator, and many     
more).                                                                          
                                                                                
. O&O DiskStat: O&O DiskStat allows you to analyze used space on your hard disk 
with the help of interactive graphics. Once identified, you can get rid of the  
space-wasters on your disks, gaining space for new programs and data, and saving
money you might have spent on a new disk.                                       
                                                                                
. O&O DriveLED: O&O DriveLED, working quietly in the background, permanently    
monitors the status of your hard disks and warns you of any impending problems. 
With it, you’ll always have time to backup your data and so avoid losing any of 
it when exchanging a hard disk. This is time a sudden crash will never give you.

rendered superfluous thanks to the integrated remote installation.              
Company-wide, you can now create regular backups, optimize system resources,    
monitor storage and much more. The Enterprise Management Console allows you to  
distribute tasks, both on individual clients and groups of computers and has an 
extensive reporting system to keep you fully informed.                          
                                                                                
. O&O FileErase: O&O FileErase destroys files and folders for you at the touch  
of a button. You can decide yourself with which security level your data should 
be destroyed. And you have full control over which files or folders O&O         
FileErase should delete for you.                                                
                                                                                
. O&O MediaRecovery: With O&O MediaRecovery you can recover deleted photos that 
captured those precious moments; last year’s vacation, the day you got married, 
or the first pictures of your children. If those irreplace-able memories are    
deleted it no longer has to mean they are lost forever.                         
And O&O MediaRecovery doesn’t stop there: it can also recover your favorite     
songs and videos, simply and quickly, and all with just a few clicks of the

. O&O SafeErase: O&O SafeErase permanently deletes your confidential files using
recognized methods so that a recovery is never possible, not even when using the
best file recovery software.                                                    
                                                                                
. O&O SSD Migration Kit: The O&O SSD Migration Kit enables an easy and          
convenient migration of your partitions (drives) from conventional hard drives  
to SSDs (Solid State Drives). This leads to the creation of a duplicate of the  
selected drives on the SSD or on a drive of the SSD.

HOW TO USE

1. Select the target product from the list and click "Generate". You can use the
"C" button at the right side of each registration info field to copy the field  
contents.                                                                       
                                                                                
2. Disconnet from Internet (IMPORTANT) and register the program with the        
generated reg info, or just click "Register" (if available) to save the reg info
directly to Windows registry, avoiding the manual registration. To activate EMC 
modules, go to Tools->Licensing->New.                                           
                                                                                
Note: Is recommended to block the program with a firewall.

In almost all my releases you will find an "Options" menu. This menu can be     
opened by cliking the little button with a down-arrow icon (upper-right corner  
of the main window) or with a "stack" icon (lower-right corner of the main      
window), depending on the release. This menu has two useful options:            
                                                                                
. News & Announcements: This option allows to check for the latest news         
  regarding to my site or any other important announcement.                     
                                                                                
. Check for Updates: This option allows to verify if there is a new version of  
  this release, check its changelog and download the new version directly.      
  Almost at the same time you will find the new version also posted on my site. 
                                                                                
NOTE: These options require an Internet connection in order to work. In case    
you have a firewall, probably you will need to make an exception.

Some antivirus can detect this release as a threat and try to remove it. The    
reason for this is because my releases are packed/protected in order to reduce  
its size and avoid alterations to the code. This protection can be erroneously  
identified as a threat, it is what is commonly known as a FALSE POSITIVE. Just  
ignore it, it is safe to use.                                                   
                                                                                
IMPORTANT: there will be no risk when using my releases as long as you have     
downloaded it from the links posted on my site or from the "Check for Updates"  
option. If you have downloaded this release from another site, I CANNOT         
GUARANTEE ITS INTEGRITY. In such case, I will not take responsability for
