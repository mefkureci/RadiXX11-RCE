TARGET DESCRIPTION                                                              
ииииииииииииииииии                                                              
Find the icons you need and add them into any graphics design project thanks to 
this application, which bundles a generous icon collection and searching        
capabilities.                                                                   
                                                                                
__________                                                                      
HOW TO USE                                                                      
ииииииииии                                                                      
1. Close Pichon if it is running.                                               
2. Copy Icons8.Auth.dll to the installation folder (by default: C:\Program Files
   (x86)\Pichon) and overwrite the original file.                               
3. Start the app and click the gear icon in the top-right corner or just        
   right-click in the tray icon and select "Settings".                          
4. Select "Account" in the left sidebar, then click "Login" in the right side.  
5. Enter any email you want (must have a valid email format) and anything as    
   password, then click "Login".                                                
6. Done. Now you can use the app normally, it will remain activated after close 
   it.                                                                          
                                                                                
Note: If right after the activation, the icons that appear in the current       
      category still show a dollar sign in one corner (paid), just select       
      another category and go back to the previous one to redraw the icons.

ANTIVIRUS & FALSE POSITIVES                                                     
иииииииииииииииииииииииииии                                                     
Some antivirus can detect this release as a threat and try to remove it. The    
reason for this is because my releases are packed/protected in order to reduce  
its size and avoid alterations to the code. This protection can be erroneously  
identified as a threat, it is what is commonly known as a FALSE POSITIVE. Just  
ignore it, it is safe to use.                                                   
                                                                                
IMPORTANT: there will be no risk when using my releases as long as you have     
downloaded it from the links posted on my site or from the "Check for Updates"  
option. If you have downloaded this release from another site, I CANNOT         
GUARANTEE ITS INTEGRITY. In such case, I will not take responsability for       
eventual problems that arise when using it. Be careful!                         
                                                                                
As a precaution, always check the release hashes.
